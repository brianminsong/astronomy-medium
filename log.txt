Okay so we are making a data retrieval tool for the astronomy department's SPARC data.
Data can be found here: http://astroweb.case.edu/SPARC/SPARC_Lelli2016c.mrt

Fields that it currently has:
- galaxy name
- hubble type
- distance
- mean error on D
- distance method
- inclination
- mean error on inclination
- total luminosity
- Mean error or L
- effective radius
- effective surface brightness
- disk scale length
- disk central surface brightness
- total HI mass
- hi radius at 1 Msun/pc2
- Asymptotically Flat Rotation Velocity
- Mean error on Vflat
- Quality Flag
- References for HI and HA data


Okay so given all this data and these fields. I want to make something similar to the CPR Diagnostics table page
Give the user the ability to filter the data, as well as sort/order the data by a certain header.

The data is in an MRT format. Convert this to either a table or excel or something that the javascript could use.
MRT is said to be standard. as long as it has the rows and columns, I should be bing chilling.
Data will be hard stored.

For the headers:
Not all of them needs to be sorted. Like the galaxy name is a string so you prob dont wanna filter that.
So with the headers, we want to add tags to declare that it can be filterable.



Filters:
Greater than
Greater than or equal to
Less than
Less than or equal to
Equal to (with a +- range)

This will then apply the filters to the data, giving a filtered list

Data table:
Will take in the filtered list and display everything in the order that's just currently listed.


10/6/23 progress
parsed the data, could not get to read the MRT, so i have to manually convert it to a csv
and then to json
and then to js 2d array

using this library for displaying:
https://github.com/gregnb/mui-datatables

I am able to show all of the data, also incorperated a sorting by (kinda janky, need to update)

Now need to work on adding the filters


fixed format reading

filter options:


graphing:
EVerything with respect to radius for http://astroweb.case.edu/SPARC/MassModels_Lelli2016c.mrt


11/30

pick the galaxies you want, and then for each one chosen there is additonal data to graph




12/8
if there is only one galaxy chosen, then checkbox

if there are multiple galaxies chosen, then radios
